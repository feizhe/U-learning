# U-learning
 Prediction inference and predictive intervals with Lasso and NN

## Simulations

`sim2_scaledLasso.Rmd` performs U-learning with LASSO as the base learner.

`NN_sim7_v3.ipynb` performs U-learning with NN as the base learner.

`NN_SIM7_HPCC.Rmd` summarize the simulation results from NN U-learning.
